A powerful file-system based web framework powered by the Wolfram Language. Use HTML files with special tags to execute code dynamically, serve files, and much more. Compatible from versions from **11.2.0** ─ **12.1.0**.

## Features
- **Powerful** ─ Create _parametric plots_, solve _differential equations_, get _stock market data_, _neural networks_, _back-end_ code, and render it as a HTML page.

- **Native** ─ The WebWL engine is 100% Mathematica code, unlike other projects like [WolframWebEngineForPython](https://github.com/WolframResearch/WolframWebEngineForPython), it's entirely made with one single language.

- **File-system Based** ─ The WebWL engine is file-system based. It can create routes using files on a folder and logic using snippets of code inside HTML files.

## Prerequisites

- Mathematica v11.2.0+ _or_ Wolfram Engine v11.2.0+

## Usage
Install **WebWL**, and execute the file with the path to your project as an argument.
```sh
/path/to/WebWL.wls /path/to/project/
```
